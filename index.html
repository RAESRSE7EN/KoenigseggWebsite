                    Koenigsegg is probably best known for being largely unknown, which makes sense since this Swedish automaker builds ultra-exclusive and ultra-expensive hypercars. While legendary models such as the Agera are no longer available, its otherworldly performance and panache is perpetuated by the company's other models

                <h3>
                    The engine is a development of the 5.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the Agera. It has four valves per cylinder each with a bore and stroke of 92 mm × 95.25 mm (3.62 by 3.75 inches) and a compression ratio of 8.6:1. The engine has a power output of 955 kW (1,298 PS; 1,281 hp) at 7800 rpm and 1,000 N⋅m (738 lb⋅ft) of torque at 2700 to 6170 rpm on normal gasoline and has a power output of 1,195 kW (1,625 PS; 1,603 hp) and 1,500 N⋅m (1,106 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,100 rpm on E85 biofuel.
            <br>Changes from the Agera's engine include the use of a new 180-degree flat-plane crankshaft that saves 5 kg (11 lb) and increases the redline from 8,250 rpm to 8,500 rpm. The Jesko also utilises active rubber mounts from the Regera that reduce engine vibrations in the cabin. The two large turbochargers are equipped with a 20-litre air tank made from carbon fibre, coupled with an electric compressor which feeds pressurised air to the turbochargers at a pressure of 20 bar (290 psi) in order to reduce turbo lag. The engine has pressure sensors for each cylinder in order to achieve real time cylinder monitoring for the multipoint fuel injection system

A horizontal rear damper prevents the rear from pressing on the ground during hard acceleration. The front dampers stabilise the car at high speeds while active rear wheel steering ensures further stability at all performance levels.
                    The carbon body tub used in the Jesko is 40 mm (2 in) longer and 22 mm (1 in) wider from that of its predecessor in order for more passenger room. The tub has been redesigned and incorporates an aluminium monocoque structure for increased rigidity.

                    The Gemera is the first four-seater car built by Koenigsegg and the first to be powered by a compact engine weighing only 70 kg (150 lb). The engine is so small because it is a camless piston engine, the first such engine announced for a production car. Called the Tiny Friendly Giant (TFG), it displaces 1988.25cc and has two turbos and three cylinders driving the front wheels and charging the batteries. It is rated at 590 hp (440 kW) at 7500 rpm, with a redline at 8500 rpm, and 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque from 2000 rpm to 7000 rpm. There are also three electric motors, one for each rear wheel with 500 bhp and 1000 Nm each and one on the crankshaft with 400 bhp and 500 Nm to power the front wheels; these combine to give 1,100 horsepower (820 kW) of electric power; together with the engine this gives a combined peak output of 1,268 kW (1,700 hp; 1,724 PS) and 3,500 N⋅m (2,581 lb⋅ft) of torque (maximum torque 11,000 N⋅m (8,113 lb⋅ft) at 4000 rpm). These outputs are produced when the engine runs on E85 fuel, but it can run on any major fuel from E100 to standard gasoline The engine also features cylinder deactivation and claims to be 20 percent more fuel efficient than a typical four-cylinder engine of the same displacement.

                    The Gemera is one of the safest megacars out there and it is designed for world-wide homologation. The Gemera has a very strong carbon fiber monocoque, six smart airbags, stability control, TC, ABS and ADAS 2.5. It lacks nothing in ultimate safety. The all-wheel steering and all-wheel drive and all-wheel torque vectoring give the Gemera maximum opportunity to offer a safe, stable and exhilarating drive. ISOFIX is available for both rear seats.

            The Gemera is the first of its kind in a completely new vehicle category. Still, it has clear ties to all previous Koenigsegg cars and their Swedish and understated design roots. The Gemera maintains many recognizable Koenigsegg traits like its wrap-around jet fighter inspired windshield, the hidden A-pillars, the simple shapes, the short overhangs and the large side air intakes.

                    Initial packaging studies, ergonomic research and technical development of the Gemera started long before RAW Design House was formed. However the definitive exterior shape of the car as well as the entire interior were born out of the most challenging yet fulfilling final months of 2019. Christian's vision was clear: a car should deceive with its looks. Nobody should be able to tell that it is a four seater, instead it should look like a thoroughbred hypercar, as every preceding Koenigsegg does. Our team created a set of digital models in a span of a couple of weeks. With careful refinement and direct input from the client the design matured and gained its unmistakable Koenigsegg DNA. As is customary for RAW Design House's process, the design was milled in foam for a review and consequently reworked digitally until both the design team and the client were satisfied. Gemera's fluid lines and refined surfaces are a product of purely digital design process. We adhere to our core principles: no effort was wasted on illustrations, clay models, reverse engineering etc. Gemera was designed in record time with the use of digital only tools.

                <h3>
                    The Agera is powered by an in-house developed 5.0-litre V8 engine and fitted with twin-turbochargers which generates a maximum power output of 706 kW (960 PS; 947 hp) at 6,900 rpm and 1,100 N⋅m (811 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 4,000 rpm. The total weight of the engine is only 197 kg (434 lb) due to a carbon fibre inlet manifold and aluminium construction. The transmission is a specially developed CIMA 7-speed dual-clutch with paddle shifters. It is the first dual-clutch transmission to feature only one input shaft. The second clutch slows down the input shaft during up shifts in order to reduce the time it takes to synchronise the next gear, resulting in faster shift times. Most notably, the transmission weighs only 81 kg (179 lb).

              <h3>
                The Agera has a body made from impregnated carbon fibre/kevlar with lightweight reinforcements. The car's hardtop roof is stowable under the front hood lid. The chassis is also made out of carbon fibre with an aluminium honeycomb structure that comes with integrated fuel tanks for optimal weight distribution and safety. The rear wing is electronically adjustable with auto setting or manual control in order to have as little compromise as possible between low drag and downforce, depending on driving conditions. The Agera comes with forged aluminum wheels with centre locking nuts, measuring 19-inch on the front and 20-inch on the rear and wrapped in a set of Michelin Super Sport tyres that can be used for speeds of up to 420 km/h (260 mph). Other notable features include the trademark "dihedral-synchro-helix-actuation" doors, a new traction control system, LED lighting, blue hood stripes that continue through the cockpit of the car and a custom interior with a new "Ghost light" lighting system, which uses carbon nanotubes in a unique configuration to shine through the car's aluminium buttons.

                    The Swedish automaker charged $2.85 million for the One:1, a special edition which produced 1,360 hp and weighed 1,360 kg (2,998 lbs). Agera production finished in 2018 and used prices have only gone up more and more since then. If you want to buy a standard Agera in 2022 expect to pay over $3 million
